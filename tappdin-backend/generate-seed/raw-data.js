Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"nHLlnK","name":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Nevada","description":"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.

Where go we indeed, whatever that means.","website":"http://www.lagunitas.com/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"C0zPjd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1280 North McDowell Boulevard","locality":"Petaluma","region":"California","postalCode":"94954","phone":"707 769-4495","website":"http://www.lagunitas.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","latitude":38.272435,"longitude":-122.662346,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"g2d9B7","name":"Chicago","streetAddress":"2607 West 17th St.","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60608","phone":"(773) 522-2503","website":"http://lagunitas.com/","latitude":41.8579099,"longitude":-87.691899,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 12:10:03","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"s38mA2","name":"Charleston Taproom & Beer Sanctuary","streetAddress":"161 E Bay St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29401","phone":"843-853-4677","latitude":32.7784426,"longitude":-79.927534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"o4farp","name":"Gravitation Collaboration","nameDisplay":"Gravitation Collaboration","abv":"7.8","styleId":89,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-03 13:02:35","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":89,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","shortName":"Maibock","description":"The German word helle means light colored, and as such, a heller Bock is light straw to deep golden in color.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"avUZok","name":"Ground Score","nameDisplay":"Ground Score","description":"We’ve teamed up with Relix and Kyle Hollingsworth to bring you a haze-bomb of a brew: Ground Score IPA.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"56HXGK","name":"GUARD de BEER","nameDisplay":"GUARD de BEER","abv":"7","styleId":71,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/56HXGK/upload_qeT7dw-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-31 13:53:32","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bière de Garde","shortName":"Bière de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.","website":"http://www.guinness.com/","established":"1759","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9RsQkk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"109 James's Street","locality":"Dublin City","region":"Dublin","postalCode":"8","website":"http://www.guinness.com/","latitude":53.34309,"longitude":-6.290799,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1759","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eCmjOc","name":"Pear Champagne","nameDisplay":"Pear Champagne","abv":"5.3","ibu":"22","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 21:21:18","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.","website":"http://www.sierranevada.com/","established":"1980","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IaQrxj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1075 East 20th St","locality":"Chico","region":"California","postalCode":"95928","phone":"530-893-3520","website":"http://www.sierranevada.com/","latitude":39.7246028,"longitude":-121.8157154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1980","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"aqLvLE","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"100 Sierra Nevada Way","locality":"Fletcher","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28732","latitude":35.4303824,"longitude":-82.5489214,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-29 20:56:05","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7aZN1V","name":"Plum Gose","nameDisplay":"Plum Gose","description":"Plum","abv":"4.5","styleId":47,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-14 12:50:02","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":47,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Leipzig-Style Gose","shortName":"Leipzig Gose","description":"Traditional examples of Gose are spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"IImUD9","name":"Breckenridge Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Breckenridge","description":"Breckenridge Brewery was founded in 1990 in Breckenridge, Colorado.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

We’re not brewing beer to put trophies on our mantels, but it’s nice to be appreciated.","website":"http://www.lastnamebrewing.com/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/941OaA/upload_bqCPwM-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/941OaA/upload_bqCPwM-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/941OaA/upload_bqCPwM-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/941OaA/upload_bqCPwM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/941OaA/upload_bqCPwM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UFie4f","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2120 Porterfield Way","locality":"Upland","region":"California","postalCode":"91786","phone":"909-579-0032","website":"http://www.dalebrosbrewery.com/","latitude":34.1091852,"longitude":-117.6909341,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"T9hizi","name":"Pond Scum","nameDisplay":"Pond Scum","availableId":2,"styleId":3,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 21:37:48","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WUHF66","name":"Rascal's Wild Red","nameDisplay":"Rascal's Wild Red","abv":"8","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-28 17:52:15","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"nHLlnK","name":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Nevada","description":"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"q6vJUK","name":"Oskar Blues Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Oskar Blues","description":"Oskar Blues Brewery is part of the Oskar Blues Grill and Brew restaurant and was located in Lyons, Colorado, near the city of Boulder.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"BznahA","name":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","nameShortDisplay":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","description":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit

If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"uM2jeT","name":"Brouwerij De Leite","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij De Leite","description":"Brewing since 1997.

During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RsGMGn","name":"Festive Ale","nameDisplay":"Festive Ale (2013)","abv":"8.5","availableId":4,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2013,"labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/RsGMGn/upload_osBvWa-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-13 01:20:22","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"SweetWater Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater","description":"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger. After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rJ51vR","name":"Freedom Tickler","nameDisplay":"Freedom Tickler","abv":"6.8","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/rJ51vR/upload_W74RGx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-21 13:17:47","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"AqEUBQ","name":"New Holland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"New Holland","description":"New Holland Brewing Company’s deep roots in the craft industry go back to 1997.

The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

The gravity of the wort was a little higher than expected, owed to the efficiency of the brewhouse and the Daytime mash profile. Fermentation went very well and the beer finished out in about 3 days, also at a lower F.G. than expected. As a result the alcohol was indeed higher than expected, in fact the lab results just came in and our Brown Ale is 5.5% ABV. We did in fact choose Simcoe and Nelson Sauvin for the dry hop, but we also included two more of our favorites, the elusive and rare Citra and and the ever sexy Mosaic (dry hopped at 1.6 lbs/BBL). After 3 days of extraction, 2 days of cooling, and another 2 days cold stable, the beer was filtered bright last night (July 31st), and packaged this morning (August 1st). The beer is decidedly dry and drinkable, with the impressive bouquet of hop aromas and resinous kettle hop being the main event. Delicate, slightly toasted malts and a spicy rye malt backbone remain subdued, but ever present.Short version:I think as Jeremy put it on the day of recipe formulation: \"An easy drinking, hoppy brown ale.\"","abv":"5.5","availableId":3,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/w7z0LS/upload_TxnQg0-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-10 17:11:07","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world.

The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"p1tFbP","name":"Jackalope Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Jackalope","description":"Jackalope Brewing Company is owned by Bailey Spaulding and Robyn Virball, two young ingénues with an affection for beer.

They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http://www.jackalopebrew.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4BzAQE","name":"Happy Ending","nameDisplay":"Happy Ending (2014)","description":"This seasonal “Catch and Release” Imperial Stout is a dry hopped stiffy, leading to an explosive finish at 9% ABV that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.\r\nAvailable late December thru early March, in six packs, 22oz. bombers, 15.5 and 5.2 gallon kegs.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"SweetWater Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater","description":"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"SweetWater Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater","description":"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger.

Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage flavor characteristics. Their flavor is primarily derived from added flavoring rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. However,  flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers. Their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages – in the range of 4-6% alcohol by volume.","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:15:20","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:43"},"breweries":[{"id":"BznahA","name":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","nameShortDisplay":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","description":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"AqEUBQ","name":"New Holland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"New Holland","description":"New Holland Brewing Company’s deep roots in the craft industry go back to 1997.

Old Cantankerous was brewed with a combination of seven different domestic & continental malts including two types of Caramel, Chocolate, Pale, Pils, Munich & Vienna for a rich complexity with five different hops being used for balance & character including Magnum, Perle, Sterling & the New Zealand hops Pacifica & Southern Cross which were used in the hopback for additional aroma & complexity. The famous house ale yeast was used to top ferment & condition this American Strong Ale/Stock Ale for approx. 8-10 weeks.

Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"nHLlnK","name":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Nevada","description":"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"p1tFbP","name":"Jackalope Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Jackalope","description":"Jackalope Brewing Company is owned by Bailey Spaulding and Robyn Virball, two young ingénues with an affection for beer.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"q6vJUK","name":"Oskar Blues Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Oskar Blues","description":"Oskar Blues Brewery is part of the Oskar Blues Grill and Brew restaurant and was located in Lyons, Colorado, near the city of Boulder.

Where go we indeed, whatever that means.","website":"http://www.lagunitas.com/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nLsoQ9/upload_WqZkvw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"C0zPjd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1280 North McDowell Boulevard","locality":"Petaluma","region":"California","postalCode":"94954","phone":"707 769-4495","website":"http://www.lagunitas.com/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","latitude":38.272435,"longitude":-122.662346,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"g2d9B7","name":"Chicago","streetAddress":"2607 West 17th St.","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60608","phone":"(773) 522-2503","website":"http://lagunitas.com/","latitude":41.8579099,"longitude":-87.691899,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 12:10:03","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"s38mA2","name":"Charleston Taproom & Beer Sanctuary","streetAddress":"161 E Bay St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29401","phone":"843-853-4677","latitude":32.7784426,"longitude":-79.927534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1C793t","name":"Centennial Saison","nameDisplay":"Centennial Saison","abv":"6","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-18 17:33:29","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"SweetWater Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater","description":"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger. After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"q6vJUK","name":"Oskar Blues Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Oskar Blues","description":"Oskar Blues Brewery is part of the Oskar Blues Grill and Brew restaurant and was located in Lyons, Colorado, near the city of Boulder.

Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.","website":"http://www.sierranevada.com/","established":"1980","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/nHLlnK/upload_IClwuZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IaQrxj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1075 East 20th St","locality":"Chico","region":"California","postalCode":"95928","phone":"530-893-3520","website":"http://www.sierranevada.com/","latitude":39.7246028,"longitude":-121.8157154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1980","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"aqLvLE","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"100 Sierra Nevada Way","locality":"Fletcher","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28732","latitude":35.4303824,"longitude":-82.5489214,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-29 20:56:05","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","timezoneId":"America/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gfFqa1","name":"Cold Nose Winter Ale","nameDisplay":"Cold Nose Winter Ale","description":"Cold Nose Winter Ale, An American twist on the Old ale Style of beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew this beer with plenty of malt and hops then dry hop for that American style winter brew, this is the beer to warm you up after working or playing outside and perhaps getting your Nose cold.","availableId":3,"styleId":13,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/gfFqa1/upload_YzrPFW-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-02 22:45:07","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":13,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Old Ale","shortName":"Old Ale","description":"Dark amber to brown in color, old ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ehb1eB","name":"Country Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Country Pale Ale","description":"Our original brew crafted by Ned, Kevin and Quinny in the early 90's with super drinkability.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"17","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/ehb1eB/upload_BsecYt-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-03 12:20:41","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"J183HL","name":"London Calling","nameDisplay":"London Calling","description":"English Style Session Ale","abv":"3.2","styleId":10,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-10 23:41:31","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.

To pay homage to the Southern roots of Oskar Blues, our buddy Jonny Barber and the smooth character of this beer, we chose to name it the Velvet Elvis.  He even made an appearance in the brewery several weeks ago for the brewing of this beer. Check out the Velvet Elvis Video, and enjoy this smooth Stout during the winter months.","availableId":2,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 21:36:27","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8rc5kA","name":"Wachusetts IPA","nameDisplay":"Wachusetts IPA","description":"Dry-hopped with Cascade for an awesome floral nose.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"50","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/8rc5kA/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:28","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"IImUD9","name":"Breckenridge Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Breckenridge","description":"Breckenridge Brewery was founded in 1990 in Breckenridge, Colorado.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/brewery/4F7QA9/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:14:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5pJqvf","name":"Willett Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout","nameDisplay":"Willett Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout","description":"This is Lagunitas Imperial Stout aged in Willett Bourbon Barrels in the Chicago Brewery.","abv":"11.5","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 17:30:35","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"nLsoQ9","name":"Lagunitas Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lagunitas","description":"From our earliest days of striving to make consistently good beer, and instead making beer that ranged from vile, to barely drinkable, to wonderful, to elegant, to questionable-at-best.
